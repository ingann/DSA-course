# DSA-course

Datastructures and algorithms -course exercises. These exercises have solutions to many algorithm problems. These solutions are such as efficient algorithms, hashing, sorting, trees and recursion, graph algorithms, DFS- and BFS methods to find answers from a graph, finding the shortest path, dynamic programming, binary search tree, directed and undirected graphs, components and spanning trees, and maximum flow. In this course I learned how to reduce time complexity while creating a solution to a challenging problem.
